		I am currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/graduate-programs/bioinformatics-and-genomics/student-resources/ph-d-requirements/core-requirements" target="_blank">Bioinformatics and Genomics</a> program at the <a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania State University</a>. I was awarded the <a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/resources/students/graduate-students/funding-sources" target="_blank">Huck Distinguished Graduate Fellowship</a> and <a href="https://science.psu.edu/diversity/graduate-students" target="_blank">Robert W. Graham Endowed Graduate Fellowship</a>
		My research interests are <b>Statistical Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Precision Medicine</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		I worked as a bioinformatics consultant at the <a href="http://el.ladlab.org/" target="_blank">David lab at Duke University</a>. I created several pipelines for reference database curation using the QIIME2 framework. I generated phylogenetic trees and validated with BLAST for in silico primer testing.

		I was awarded by the DOST-SEI Career Incentive Program a three-year research fellowship at the Center for Natural Sciences and Environmental Research (CENSER) <a href="https://dlsu-scomb.github.io" target="_blank">Systems and Computational Biology (SComB) Unit</a> of the College of Science at <a href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/" target="_blank">De La Salle University (DLSU)</a>, under the supervision of Prof. Angelyn Lao. I was concurrently a member of the Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing and Networking (AdRIC) <a href="https://bioinfodlsu.com/" target="_blank">Bioinformatics Lab</a> of the College of Computer Studies at DLSU, under the supervision of Dr. Anish M.S. Shrestha. I was involved in the <a href="https://www.the-easia.org/jrp/projects/project_76.html" target="_blank">e-Asia JRP</a>-funded project <a href="https://dlsu-scomb.github.io/projects/" target="_blank">Alternative therapeutics to tackle AMR pathogens</a>. I also worked on mathematical modeling using ordinary differential equations, co-authorship network analysis, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. I also co-mentored several senior high school and undergraduate students during my stint as a research fellow.

		I earned my Master of Science degree in Physics at De La Salle University. I was a member of the <a href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/colleges/cos/departments/physics/tprg/" target="_blank">Theoretical Physics Research Group</a>, headed by Prof. Emmanuel Rodulfo (also my thesis adviser). My thesis was on <a href="https://animorepository.dlsu.edu.ph/etdm_physics/2/" target="_blank">Weak deflection angle and shadow of an extended uncertainty principle black hole with dark matter halo</a>. This research was published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491621003225" target="_blank">Annals of Physics</a> (Scopus-indexed Q1(75th)) by Elsevier. I received a scholarship from the <a href="https://www.sei.dost.gov.ph/index.php/10-pap/papscholarships/66-accelerated-s-t-human-resource-development-program" target="_blank">DOST-SEI ASTHRDP program</a> that covers the tuition fee and provides a stipend for my Master's education. I was also the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=581833396134551" target="_blank">MS & PhD Physics Representative, Graduate Student Council</a>, College of Science at DLSU.

		<p>
		I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science major in Computer Systems Engineering (<i>cum laude</i>) at De La Salle University. I was a member of <a href="https://www.dlsu-lscs.org/" target="_blank">La Salle Computer Society</a>. My thesis was on <a href="https://animorepository.dlsu.edu.ph/etd_bachelors/14598/" target="_blank">Vision-based intelligent system for traffic analysis (VISTA)</a> under the guidance of Mr. Clement Ong.
